# How To Convert Photo To Embroidery / Photostitch?

If you are new to embroidery sewing, 
you may have wondered how to turn pictures 
into embroidery. It is quite easy, but we need some 
programs for it. Some of these programs are free 
and some are paid. Today I am going to teach you 
how to embroider a picture on a t-shirt, shirt 
or fabric. I am going to use the Brother PE-11 program, 
but there are other programs available. I have researched 
and made a list of these programs, which you can 
check out on [this page](https://fabricspedia.com/post/the-best-22-sewing-and-embroidery-desing-softwares/). I will show you step by step 
how to digitize and embroider pictures using the 
Brother PE-11. I even made a video for you. So We will create an Cute Harry Potter embroidery project together.
