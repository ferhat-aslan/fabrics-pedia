title: The Interesting History of Textile
---

At the beginning of the industrial revolution, **textiles (cotton)**,\*\* steel\*\*, and \*\*coal \*\*were the dynamos of the industrial revolution. Large systems (production plants) were built using coal, steel, and steam to increase cotton and textile production. There was always innovation for more production, more efficiency, minimum labor involvement, and more profit. **Sewing machines**, **spinning machines**, **cotton washing,** **picking machines**, **dyeing tools**, **chemicals**, **knitting machines**, and new machines are added daily.

Weaving, knitting  and knotting are ancient cultural technologies. For thousands of years, people all over the world have been using these techniques to make clothing and everyday objects. Textiles can be firm or supple, sturdy or light fireproof or water-resistant. Such qualities are determined by choice Of material and production technique.

It was probably made in the 1800s.")![Grossmann-Dresdensia Sewing machine 1920](</src/assets/images/Grossmann sewing machine.jpg> "A specific Sewing Machine for Hat built by Grossmann in Germany-Dresden, Straw sewing machine Dresdensia Manufacture of straw hats from sewn-in braids. 1920")In the past, a hat was worn on the head as a symbol of rank, status, profession or political opinion. Today, hats are mainly fashionable ornaments. Hat makers in trade and industry make hats mainly from felt (for winter) or straw (for summer). Milliners have been making imaginative headgear for women since the 19th century. Hat making has lost much of its importance since the second half of the 20th century. It lives on where national or religious identity is expressed in the headgear.

North America, Europe, and the United Kingdom are two states that led this industrial revolution. Today, Spanish Italian, and Japanese companies carry on this revolution.(Source : [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution-Textile Section")).

The most important textile surfaces are knitted fabrics and woven fabrics. Knitted fabrics are created by continuously interlacing loops of thread. Woven fabrics are the crossing of two thread systems. The first technique involves knitting, the second involves weaving.

Embossing the petals and leaves with heatable two-part molds for the spindle press (without stem) and the foot-operated press (with stem) 4. Fine processing of the petals by hand 5. Assembling the flowers and leaves to form the flower with stem and stamens by hand Locations of the silk flower factories in Berlin: In the 18th and 19th centuries, most flower factories were located in the hatched area. The first factory on the Gertraudenbr√ºcke and the second on the Stechbahn are particularly notable.
