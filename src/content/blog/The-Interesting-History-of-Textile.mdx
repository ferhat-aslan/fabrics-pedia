title: The Interesting History of Textile
---

At the beginning of the industrial revolution, **textiles (cotton)**,** steel**, and **coal **were the dynamos of the industrial revolution. Large systems (production plants) were built using coal, steel, and steam to increase cotton and textile production. There was always innovation for more production, more efficiency, minimum labor involvement, and more profit. **Sewing machines**, **spinning machines**, **cotton washing,** **picking machines**, **dyeing tools**, **chemicals**, **knitting machines**, and new machines are added daily.
