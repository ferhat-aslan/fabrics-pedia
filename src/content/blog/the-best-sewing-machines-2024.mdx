              The SE2100Di Brother Disney Sewing and embroidery machine is
              equipped with an online code that enables the download of

              Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, as well as popular Disney princesses
              and iconic movie characters such as Ursula and Stitch. The
              **ARTSPIRA mobile app** allows for the creation of
              custom embroidery patterns by drawing on a mobile device, or by
              downloading patterns from the collection and transferring them
              wirelessly to the SE2100Di through a
              **Wireless LAN connection**. This machine offers both
              sewing and embroidery capabilities, with a

              the order in which colors are stitched, thereby reducing color
              changes. The Jump Stitch Trimming function automatically trims
              excess thread jumps within the color. The SE2100Di features a
              large **3.7-inch LCD touchscreen** that allows for
